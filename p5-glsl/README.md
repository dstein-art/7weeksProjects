The following is a "how-to" to show how to use GLSL within P5. It includes the ability to pass a variety of different data types (UNIFORMS) to the shader as well as drawing the basic shapes circle and line.

Note, this “how-to” assumes some knowledge of GLSL. I will attempt to comment on how some of my code works, but the main instruction that I am looking to cover is how to use GLSL within Javascript. This includes how to pass different types of data to the Shader and how the shader renders within P5.
